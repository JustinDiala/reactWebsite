# Personal Website that is created using Reactjs
Created by: Justin Diala Computer Engineer Nanoscale Systems Design Co-op class of 2022

This is an ongoing project started on March 2020. Main objectives is to create a website using Reactjs and to learn Reactjs more in depth.

Feel free to use this is a template for your own website! Currently the README is still being updated constantly. Expect a full proper README with instructions on how to run and install it on your machine.

There will be a 2nd part to this project hopefully! Which will explore concepts of hosting the Website using possible a microcontroller like an Arduino or a Raspberry Pi.

Thanks very much and happy hacking!
